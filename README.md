# organize_photo
Personal project to organize the photo collection. Part of the photo collection is in digital form with no folder structure for the last 5 years. The other part is in hard copy form, I have started scaning them but so far the progress is <= 5%. 

I need a software that can :

- Scan a location for pictures. (Autodiscover)
- Find Duplicates. (Deduplication)
- Order them by date from multiple sources. 
- Face recognition tagging. (Autotag) 
- Web based photo viewer.



## Research for some open source projects - https://medevel.com/os-photo-collection-self-hosted/

One projects that I think covers most of the required features is: https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos
